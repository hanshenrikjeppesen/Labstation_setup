## <span>Introduction</span>

In the following we are going to set up your lab-network so it is possible for you to work on the project building your robot car. The lab station setup will include a couple of different components. (See the Picture for more information). Each group is going to setup this network and working station. We will learn about the difference between a ´switch´ and a ´router´, what is a ´LAN´ vs. ´WAN´. Why do we need static IP addresses and we will be working with different Operating systems.

To divide it into modules, we will start with setting up the Project-Pi (Raspberry Pi) with a operating system called Raspbian Stretch Lite, you can read more about this subject here.
