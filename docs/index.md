## <span>Introduction</span>

In the following, we are going to set up your lab-network so it is possible for you to work on the project building your robot car. The lab station setup will include a couple of different components. (See the Picture for more information). Each group is going to set up this network and working station.

We will learn about the difference between a ```switch``` and a ```router```

What is a ```LAN``` vs. ```WAN```

We will work with ```Server``` and ```Client```

Why do we need ```static IP addresses```

...and we will be working with different ```Operating systems```.

To divide it into modules, we will start with setting up the Project-Pi (Raspberry Pi) with an operating system called Raspbian Stretch Lite, you can read more about this subject here.
